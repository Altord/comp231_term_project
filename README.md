Discussion of Changes from Iteration to Iteration:
1.	Iteration 1: The project started with high momentum, with 45 story points completed. However, there was a slight underestimation in the initial estimation of 10 story points, suggesting the need for better estimation techniques. Additionally, new stories worth 18 points were introduced during this iteration, indicating a dynamic project scope.
2.	Iteration 2: Despite completing 47 story points, the team experienced a deviation from the plan, with a slight overestimation of 4 points. This iteration saw fewer new stories (8 points) compared to the previous iteration, reflecting a more stable project scope. However, the project progressed well towards the goal.
3.	Iteration 3: This iteration marked a significant decrease in story points, with only 48 points completed. The team recognized an overestimation of 3 points, highlighting the importance of refining the estimation process. Despite introducing only 4 new story points, the project moved closer to completion, albeit at a slower pace.
4.	Iteration 4: The final iteration saw the completion of the remaining 31 story points, aligning with the project's conclusion. No new stories were introduced, indicating a clear project scope. This iteration emphasized the importance of accurate estimation, as any deviation could impact the project's timeline and deliverables.

Plot Iteration Burndown Chart:
The iteration burndown chart visually represents the progress of the project across iterations. It demonstrates the remaining work over time, allowing stakeholders to track the project's trajectory and make informed decisions. The chart should reflect the fluctuations in story points throughout each iteration, providing insights into the project's velocity and overall progress.
